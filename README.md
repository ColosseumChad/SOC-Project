# CHILD FACE GENERATOR
1) First I started by learning the usage of github and its various techniques such as commiting, pull, push
2) Then I learned python (which I almost completed) from the PYCK website of WnCC and practised a bit
3) I also applied for coursera courses of Neural Networks, Deep Learning and will start with those post our midsems
